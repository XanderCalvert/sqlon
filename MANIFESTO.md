# SQLON Manifesto

## Purpose
SQLON (SQL Object Notation) is an experimental language and toolchain
that treats relational structure as the canonical representation of data.

## Core Principles
- Relational-first normalisation
- Explicit schemas over inferred structure
- Canonical internal representation
- Human-readable and inspectable formats
- Simplicity over completeness

## Non-Goals
- Replacing JSON, XML, or CSV
- Schema-less data modelling
- Perfect round-tripping of source formats
- Production-grade guarantees (at this stage)

## Philosophy on Change
SQLON values clarity over flexibility.
Features that increase expressiveness must justify their cost in complexity.

## Project Status
SQLON is an exploratory project.
Breaking changes are expected.
Learning and experimentation are first-class goals.
